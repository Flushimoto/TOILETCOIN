      <p>Past midnight on a dead-still highway, Satoshi Flushimoto—more liquidations than wins—hunted for relief when destiny (and indigestion) struck.</p>
      <p>He found a forgotten gas station, a grimy stall, and—mid-poop, straining—the revelation: if the market is a toilet, it needs a Final Flush. He deployed <strong>TOILETCOIN</strong> on Pump.fun, minted <strong>1,000,000,000</strong>, bought the first <strong>1,000,000</strong>, scrawled the contract on a tile, wrote the Wipepaper on two-ply, and vanished.</p>
      <p>Days later a janitor posted the artifacts. The owner built a shrine. Pilgrims now queue for the next stall. Profits? ~<strong>6,900,000×</strong>.</p>
