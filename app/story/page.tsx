          <p className="lead">
            Past midnight on a dead-still highway, Satoshi Flushimoto—more liquidations than wins—hunted for relief when destiny (and indigestion) struck.

          <p>
            He found a forgotten gas station, a grimy stall, and—mid-poop, straining—the revelation: if the market is a toilet, it needs a Final Flush. Right there he deployed <strong>TOILETCOIN</strong> on Pump.fun, minted <strong>1,000,000,000</strong> supply, bought the first <strong>1,000,000</strong> as a parody of Satoshi’s stash, scrawled the contract and crooked toilet logo on a tile (the Genesis Tile), jotted the Wipepaper on two-ply, and vanished into the night.

            Days later a janitor found the artifacts, posted them online, and the legend spread. The owner built a shrine over the sacred stall. Pilgrims now line up at the next-door stall; his profits? ~<strong>6,900,000×</strong>. At least someone matched Bitcoin’s growth.
